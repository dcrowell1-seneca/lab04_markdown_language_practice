# Appendix B: Academic integrity violations – guidelines for sanctions
## Overview
Seneca Polytechnic’s Academic Integrity Program has established sanctions that are imposed according to the nature and extent of the 
academic integrity offence.

These guidelines for sanctions are not intended to restrict the authority or flexibility of the Academic Integrity Committee in imposing 
sanctions. The sanctions imposed should reasonably reflect the circumstances, including the severity of the violation, the student’s stage 
of learning and any other relevant factors (see Factors for Consideration section below).

For the benefit of students, the Academic Integrity Committee shall explain in its written decision the significant reasons the sanctions 
imposed where deemed warranted. 

## Types of sanctions
Sanctions may include one or more of the following, as determined to be appropriate based on the severity of the offence:

- a verbal or written warning, with opportunities to learn from the experience
- required completion of an academic integrity assignment(s) or course(s)
- a make-up assignment or rewriting of an assignment, examination or work
- a lower grade on an assessment (e.g., assignment, examination or course work)  
- a lower grade in the course
- failure in the course
- suspension from Seneca for a minimum of three (3) consecutive terms to a maximum of nine consecutive terms, based on the discretion of
the Academic Integrity Committee and approval from the respective dean
- permanent expulsion from Seneca when a student returns to the institution after being suspended under the provisions outlined above and
commits a subsequent academic integrity offence
- other penalties as may be appropriate in the circumstances

## Factors for consideration
With each academic integrity violation, the Academic Integrity Committee shall exercise discretion considering the relevant factors. 
The Academic Integrity Committee may impose a less severe penalty. Conversely, if the matter escalates, the Student Conduct Office can be 
engaged as required.

Factors to be considered in imposing sanctions or reviewing sanction recommendations include:

- extent of the violation – the actions that constitute specific academic integrity violations vary in severity – some academic integrity offences include minor infractions, while others represent the most extreme violation
-the student’s level of academic experience
- value of the assessment
- extenuating circumstances that may help explain the action taken by the student with due weight being attached to those circumstances
- whether the student admits guilt and accepts responsibility for their action(s)
- prior incidents

## Recording of sanctions
Any academic sanction(s) imposed will be recorded on the student’s account and/or record.  Indicators attached to a student’s account can 
include:

- Academic Integrity Warning (AIW)
- Academic Integrity Offence (AIO)
- Academic Integrity Suspension (AIS)

**Note:** If the offence is a second (or subsequent) one for the student and/or is in combination with another offence, then a more 
severe penalty should be considered.

**Approval Date:** July 2018

**Last Revision:**  May 2024
